This is an exploitation tool which deliver scripts through http.

Their are sample commands for test but you can add any of your commands.

It is better to use port 80(http) or port 443(https(http over ssl)) on your exploitation.

This tool uses AES(Advanced Encryption standard) for encypt datas when sending and reciveing

Here are some cases that this might not work:
	1) Network: you have to be on the same network with the target
	2) interface: you have to choose the same interface which you connect with the target,
		use arp -a on command prompt
		example:
		C:\> arp -a

		so if i want to exploit on interface 0xb (virtual machine) network, I have to use ip 192.168.177.1 for the listener
		

	3) encryption problems: if your listeners encryption key and your payload's key aren't the same, the payload wouldn't know what to do and the listener wouldn't know what to preview.
		how to solve: always use a new generated payload, so they will have the same key, and if you dont want to create new one or if you already sended the payload program, use the same key on the listener that you used to give for generating the old payload.




if there are some bugs, comment me.
and please tell me what you feel when using it, it really help me so good.
